Our team has been tasked with designing computer software for a stand alone device called 
HeartWave. HeartWave will be able to measure, analyze and display HRV (Heart Rate 
Variability) patterns through the use of an advanced heart rate monitor and provide users with 
real-time biofeedback on their coherence levels. The goal of this device is to help users reduce 
stress and achieve a high state of coherence, an optimal psychophysiological state that reflects 
well being and health. HeartWave is based on technology produced by the HeartMath institute, 
including their Inner Balance and emWave2 line of products.
